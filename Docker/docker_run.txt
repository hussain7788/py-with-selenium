1. docker run steps

 - <image>:<tag> = buff-nlp-skillbuilder:latest

 - docker build . -f Dockerfile -t <image>:<tag> 
    - '-f' refers the file name
    - '-t' refers the image tag name which we want to give 

 - docker run -it <image>:<tag> will create the container for this image 
 - docker run -it <image>:<tag> /bin/bash will run in terminal
 - docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash will execute in terminal 

---------------------------------------------------
Push the Image to a Docker Hub and share it with anyone 
---------------------------------------------------

1. docker tag <your-image-name>:<tag> <username>/<repository-name>:<tag>
 - For example, if your Docker Hub username is hussain7788 and your image is named myapp, you would do:
  - docker tag myapp:latest hussain7788/myapp:latest

2. Login to Docker Hub (or another registry): Use your credentials to log into Docker Hub
 - docker login (enter username and password)

3. Push the Image: Push the tagged image to the registry:
 - docker push hussain7788/myapp:latest

4. Share the Image: After pushing it, anyone with access (public or private) can pull the image by running:
 - docker pull hussain7788/myapp:latest

---------------------------------------------------
Export and Share the Image as a Tar Archive
---------------------------------------------------

1. docker save -o myapp_image.tar myapp:latest
 - myapp_image = image_name which we want to give in our local 
 - myapp:latest = docker image

2. Share the Image: Send the myapp_image.tar file to your recipient through a file-sharing service

3. Load the Image on the Other Machine: The recipient can load the image into their Docker environment using:
 - docker load -i myapp_image.tar
